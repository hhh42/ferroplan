# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Init-satisfied preferences are kept in the satisfaction guidance** (was:
  excluded since 0.4.0's barrier-free change). Plan forensics on tpp p05
  (`docs/forensics-tpp.md`) showed the exclusion makes the search blind to
  high-weight TRAP preferences — `not (stored goods1 level3)` is satisfied at
  init, so the guidance rewarded trampling it for a cheaper positive
  preference, and every restart-ladder profile inherited the blindness; the
  entire 93-vs-79 gap on that instance was this one decision. Re-measured on
  the 0.5 engine: keeping them takes **storage p05–p08 from 31/121/124/148 to
  25/43/60/83 — an 8/8 domain sweep vs SGPlan5** (totals 234 vs 547) — plus
  tpp 89/104/110/129 and pathways p06 11, at the cost of pathways p05 alone
  (6 → 6.5, a win becoming an exact tie). Suite tally vs SGPlan5:
  19W/15T/14L. `FF_PREF_NO_BARRIER=1` restores the 0.4–0.5.0 exclusion.

### Added

- `docs/forensics-tpp.md` — the tail-gap forensics: on zero-action-cost
  domains quality is pure end-state selection; SGPlan5's tpp p05 79 is
  derived as the closed-form selection optimum (per-goods stored level under
  supply caps + the 16-weight coupling constraints); the identified 0.6
  lever is exact selection planned as hard goals.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-14 — Closing on first: three IPC-5 domains on the defaults

The 0.5 roadmap ("First Place") executed end-to-end, shipped with its honest
verdict. On the vendored IPC-5 simple-preferences suite, **pure defaults** —
one configuration, no env vars, deterministic at any thread count — ferroplan
now **leads SGPlan5 under BOTH quality conventions (per-instance wins AND
domain totals) on three of the six domains**: openstacks (wins p04–p08, 271
vs 326), storage (wins p01–p07, 447 vs 547), and rovers (wins p04/p06/p07/
p08, exact ties p01/p05, 5301.6 vs 5632.5). trucks leads on totals (23 vs 31)
with instances drawn; tpp and pathways stay with the IPC-5 winner. Suite-wide
the instance tally is **19W / 14T / 15L** — more wins than losses against the
contest winner for the first time (0.4.0: 14/11/23). The 4-of-6 bar this
release aimed at was not met, so the claim is "closing on first," not first —
the remaining gap is exactly the tpp/pathways p05–p08 tails, measured
direction-bound (identical at 4× budget) and resistant to every lever below.
Full ledger: `benchmarks/ipc5-scoreboard.md`; the executed plan:
`docs/roadmap-0.5.md`.

### Changed

- **ESPC graduated: deterministic eval budget, default-on where it bites.**
  The penalty loop's outer budget converts from wall-clock to an evaluated-
  state pool (`FF_ESPC_EVAL_BUDGET`, default 6M) threaded through every inner
  search — thread-count and machine independent, exactly the contract
  `FF_PREF_EVAL_BUDGET` set for the B&B. `features::espc()` defaults ON (it
  engages only on deadline-pair structure — a verified no-op elsewhere);
  `FF_NO_ESPC=1` opts out; `FF_ESPC_TIME_MS` is demoted to an optional
  additional wall cap that applies only when set. The graduated default
  openstacks row reproduces the old opt-in row exactly (19/23/17/16/21/22/
  66/87; worst wall ~63 s on p04).
- **Folded numeric metrics route through the exact-closure optimizer** (was:
  legacy compiled-goal B&B). The 0.4.0 verdict that the closure path measures
  worse on rovers ("tiny-epsilon tightening churn") was an artifact of
  first-improvement restarts, which the anytime sweeps removed; with the
  routing flipped, rovers goes 935.3/653.5/1018.2/485.5/523.3/664.6/402.2/
  979.9 → **811.3/596.7/935.3/418.7/483.6/655.7/402.2/998.1** — a full
  domain lead. `FF_PREF_NUMLEGACY=1` restores the pre-0.5 split.
- **Anytime sweeps + a diversified restart ladder in both preference B&B
  loops** — the two remaining scoreboard levers, measured and landed. Each
  bounded metric sweep now tightens its bound **in place** on every acceptance
  and keeps draining (a restart happens once per eval cap, not once per
  improvement; `FF_PREF_GREEDY=1` restores first-improvement sweeps). Measured
  alone this changed no metric — the large-instance plateau was never restart
  churn but a **guidance limit** — so a capped no-improvement sweep now
  rotates the open-list weights through a fixed half-cap **profile ladder**
  (h-greedy → h-heavy → g-heavy → pure-h) under the same bound before the
  final all-remaining escalation (`FF_PREF_NO_RESTARTS=1` disables). Fully
  deterministic and thread-count independent. On the IPC-5 suite
  (`benchmarks/ipc5-scoreboard.md`): **storage now beats SGPlan5 on p01–p07
  and on the domain total** (46/145/200/263 → 31/121/124/148 on p05–p08),
  **pathways p05 flips to a win** (8.5 → 6 vs 6.5), tpp p05–p07 −4/−12/−14,
  trucks p03 1→0 and p06 6→1, openstacks default-path p01 42→23, rovers p04
  559.9→485.5 (0.1 from a tie). Cost, recorded honestly: tpp p08 +1,
  openstacks p03 +1, rovers p02 +56.8 — all already-losing instances.
  Instance tally vs SGPlan5: 14W/11T/23L → **17W/12T/19L**. The opt-in
  `FF_ESPC` openstacks path is untouched (spot-checked identical).

### Added

- `heuristic::relaxed_plan_cost` — a cost-aware relaxed plan (sums the
  selected ops' `increase` effects on a cost fluent), and an experimental
  **forgo-aware seed** built on it (`FF_PREF_SEED=1`): price each
  preference's completion from the initial state and pre-forgo those priced
  over their weight in one extra seeded solve. Measured **neutral** on rovers
  (the estimates fire correctly, but the EHC seed already lands at the same
  incumbent; identical metrics on/off across p01–p08) — default off, kept as
  the substrate for completion pricing inside the search.
- **Partitioned closure seed** (`FF_PREF_SEED3=1`, experimental, default
  off): ESPC increment 3 generalized past deadline pairs — mutex-conflict-
  pruned preference components composed into an incumbent by P3-masked,
  sibling-protected stages before the tightening loop. The composition
  genuinely works (tpp p05 composes 99 vs the 105 init-tail) but measured
  **neutral on finals**: the anytime+ladder loop reaches the same metric from
  either starting bound. Kept as the substrate for per-stage λ pricing (0.6).
- The 0.5 roadmap (`docs/roadmap-0.5.md`), now annotated with the executed
  outcome per phase.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-06 — Trajectory-constraint safety and a docs correctness pass

A correctness point release. It closes one silent-correctness footgun — PDDL3
trajectory `(:constraints ...)` were parsed but enforced by nothing, so a hard
constraint was accepted and dropped — and runs a documentation once-over that
retires the pre-0.4.0 "we trail SGPlan6" story the docs still told in places. No
engine or plan-quality change to any solve that succeeds today; the only behavior
change is that a domain declaring trajectory constraints now errors instead of
being silently mis-solved.

### Changed

- **PDDL3 trajectory constraints are now rejected instead of silently ignored.**
  The modal `(:constraints ...)` operators (`always`, `sometime`, `at-most-once`,
  `sometime-after`/`-before`, `within`, `hold-during`/`-after`) were parsed into
  the AST but enforced by no solving path, so a hard constraint was accepted and
  dropped. Every public entrypoint (`solve`, `decompose`, `Session::new`, the `ff`
  CLI) now returns a clear error (new `SolveError::Unsupported`) when a domain or
  problem carries one. Goal `(preference ...)` soft goals are unaffected — they
  live in the goal formula, not in `:constraints`, and the PDDL3 metric path still
  handles them.

### Added

- `ferroplan-py`: `temporal` mode, for parity with the `ferroplan-wasm` binding.
- Library examples `decompose.rs` and `validate_plan.rs` (the two advertised
  public APIs that had no runnable Rust example).
- An `examples/README.md` index (feature-by-feature map + reading order) and a
  `book/src/tuning.md` reference collecting the full `FF_*` env-knob family.

### Docs

- Corrected stale/contradictory documentation left over from before 0.4.0: the
  README's ESPC "not yet built" limitation (it shipped), the SGPlan5/SGPlan6
  baseline mix, the book's `results`/`metric-quality`/`pddl3`/`temporal` pages
  (which still told the pre-0.4.0 "we trail SGPlan6" story and marked timed
  initial literals / duration inequalities unsupported), the non-compiling
  `library.md` example, and the `village` example's false "`:derived` is rejected"
  claim. Archived the 0.2.1 roadmap.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-03 — Preference metrics: ferroplan takes on SGPlan5

The PDDL3 preference-metric release. On the vendored IPC-5 simple-preferences
suite (p01–p08, six domains, vs the official SGPlan5 results — see
`benchmarks/ipc5-scoreboard.md`), ferroplan goes from a distant quality 2nd to
**leading the IPC-5 winner on two domains** (openstacks via the opt-in
`FF_ESPC` partitioned penalty loop; storage on the plain defaults), **ahead on
the trucks total**, at **small-instance parity on tpp and pathways**, with
**full 48/48 coverage** (storage was 2/8) — every result deterministic and
thread-count independent.

Bumped to 0.4.0, not 0.3.1: the preference-metric default path changed (the
exact-closure optimizer replaces the compiled-goal B&B; wall time now scales
with the eval budget instead of stopping at the first failed probe) and the
public API grew (`SearchCfg::w_c`, `features::espc()` /
`set_espc_override`). Every behavior change has a restore hatch:
`FF_PREF_COMPILED`, `FF_PREF_NO_STATIC`, `FF_PREF_BARRIER`,
`FF_PREF_NO_ESCALATE`, `FF_ESPC_MONO`; budget via `FF_PREF_EVAL_BUDGET`.

### Added
- **Budget-escalating B&B retry — the eval budget becomes a real contract,
  lifting five of six IPC-5 preference domains at the default settings.**
  Both preference-metric optimizers (closure and legacy) treated one capped
  300k-eval tightening probe that found no cheaper plan as terminal, abandoning
  the optimization with most of `FF_PREF_EVAL_BUDGET` unspent — and the
  per-iteration cap was pinned at 300k, so raising the budget changed nothing
  (measured: 16x budget, identical results). A capped failure now retries the
  same bound with ALL remaining budget (deterministic eval counts, so plans
  stay thread-independent; `FF_PREF_NO_ESCALATE=1` restores the old behavior;
  the legacy loop also gains the budget accounting it never had). Measured at
  defaults: tpp p04 36 -> 35 (SGPlan5 tie, completing p01-p04 parity), tpp
  p05/p07/p08 97/131/146; trucks p07 19 -> 12 (now ahead of SGPlan5's 24 by
  half); storage p05/p06/p08 46/145/263; openstacks default p01 49 -> 42;
  rovers p02 659.3 -> 596.7 and p05 649.9 -> 523.3. Wall time now scales with
  the budget (trucks p08 ~163 s at 4 threads; lower `FF_PREF_EVAL_BUDGET` to
  trade quality for speed).
- **`SearchCfg::w_c` — experimental metric-cost open-list ordering** (default
  0.0 = priority key bit-identical), settable via `FF_PREF_COST_WEIGHT`. Built
  as the designed rovers lever and measured to be a dead end there: every
  non-zero weight collapsed rovers to the all-forgo floor (accumulated cost
  ordering buries deep goal-reaching prefixes), so the default stays 0
  everywhere and the field is documented as experimental. Additive public-API
  change to `SearchCfg` (constructors default it).
- **Exact-closure metric optimizer (new default for preference metrics) —
  storage flips from 2/8 coverage to beating SGPlan5 on p01–p05; tpp and
  pathways reach SGPlan5 parity on their small instances; trucks p08 drops
  133 → 10.** Three coupled changes to the PDDL3 path, each with a restore
  hatch:
  - *Static preference simplification* (compile): a preference whose phi is
    statically true (e.g. an `imply` over a static relation that never holds
    for that binding) can never be violated, so it is dropped before the
    Keyder–Geffner expansion — storage's quadratic forall-preference shrinks
    ~90–97% (p03: 1601 → 53 live instances; p08: 62k raw). Reported metrics
    are unaffected (the verifier scores from the original goal).
    `FF_PREF_NO_STATIC=1` restores blind expansion.
  - *Exact-closure metric search* (optimize): the anytime B&B now searches
    REAL states only, accepting a state iff the real hard goal holds and
    `cost-so-far + closure(state) < bound` — `closure` being the exact weight
    the deterministic `P3END`/collect/forgo phase tail pays from that state —
    instead of searching a compiled goal of hundreds/thousands of bookkeeping
    facts with a satisfaction-blind heuristic. The first incumbent is the tail
    applied to the initial state (instant coverage on any pure-preference
    instance); the tightening budget is a deterministic evaluated-state count
    (`FF_PREF_EVAL_BUDGET`, default 2M), so plans are thread-count
    independent, and un-capped exhaustion still proves optimality. Folded
    numeric metrics (rovers) deliberately stay on the legacy compiled-goal
    B&B; `FF_PREF_COMPILED=1` forces it everywhere. Multi-disjunct phis
    (`imply`/`exists`) now close correctly (the collect-op map kept one
    arbitrary disjunct before).
  - *Barrier-free DNF guidance*: the open-list satisfaction penalty now
    evaluates each preference's full DNF (so `imply`/`exists` preferences
    guide at all) and skips preferences already satisfied in the initial
    state — penalizing their transient dips walled off every improving
    trajectory (tpp's weight-16 `p4A` made metric 16 unreachable from 21).
    `FF_PREF_BARRIER=1` restores the old shape.

  IPC-5 defaults (release, 4 threads, all ≤ 60 s): tpp 16/24/29/36/101/116/
  133/148 (ties SGPlan5 p01–p03), storage 3/5/6/9/48/148/200/272 (beats
  SGPlan5 p01–p05; was 8/12 then nothing), trucks 0/0/1/0/0/6/19/10 (wins
  p01/p07), pathways 2/3/3/2/8.5/12.9/12.5/20.2 (ties p01–p04), openstacks
  default 49/40/29/41/67/86/153/370 (`FF_ESPC` row unchanged at 19/…/87),
  rovers unchanged. See `benchmarks/ipc5-scoreboard.md`.
- **Partitioned ESPC (opt-in `FF_ESPC`) — ferroplan now beats SGPlan5 on
  openstacks p04–p08.** The PDDL3 preference-metric penalty loop
  ("increment 2" of `docs/espc-preferences-spec.md`) couples its per-trigger λ
  schedule to a partitioned search instead of one monolithic B&B per penalty
  setting: subproblems come from the goal-interaction components of the real
  (non-compiled) goal, the shared renewable-resource variable (openstacks'
  `stacks-avail`) is excluded from component formation and priced as a global
  constraint by λ, each stage's goal is enriched with its own preference
  deliverables (the per-stage quality pressure a cost bound can't provide on
  cost-flat stage plans), the compiled `P3*` bookkeeping is closed by an exact
  phase tail, and leftover budget runs an incumbent-bounded monolithic polish
  (the "never worse than the plain B&B" floor). IPC-5 openstacks p01–p08 at
  the same 90 s budget: 42/43/55/66/81/90/151/227 →
  **19/23/17/16/21/22/66/87**, ahead of the IPC-5 winner SGPlan5 on p04–p08
  (26/36/33/67/123) — deterministic (3/3 identical runs, thread-count
  independent) and typically stall-terminated in 4–60 s. The default path is
  untouched (`FF_ESPC` stays opt-in; the other five IPC-5 preference domains
  are verified no-ops); `FF_ESPC_MONO=1` reproduces the previous monolithic
  loop. New WASM-safe toggle: `features::espc()` / `set_espc_override`.

### Fixed
- **Bevy Animator: "Animate this plan" always showed the embedded demo.** The
  Solver web page writes the domain, problem, and already-solved plan to
  `localStorage['ferroplan.handoff']` before navigating to the Animator — but no
  Rust code ever read it back, so the Animator always loaded its embedded demo
  regardless of what was actually solved and selected. `webhandoff.rs` now reads,
  parses, and applies the handoff at startup (scene + the pre-solved plan,
  autoplaying immediately — no re-solve, so it can't disagree with what the
  Solver page reported); falls back to the embedded demo if there is no handoff
  or it fails to parse. Verified in headless Chromium: no handoff → embedded
  demo; a real handoff → the handed-off domain/problem with its plan already
  playing; a corrupted handoff → clean fallback, no panic.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-02 — Solver depth: escalation, parallelism, sessions

A temporal goal that used to fail in ~45 s can now solve in ~30 ms (default-on
goal-relevance pruning); a search that used to just fail now escalates through two
more rungs before giving up (the Full demand tier, then the decomposer); and a
caller embedding the planner in a live loop gets a proper `Session` API instead of
re-grounding every tick. Measured on the 75-instance RPG temporal corpus:
**65 → 73 solved, zero regressions on anything that already solved.**

Bumped to 0.3.0, not 0.2.3: this release adds a new public API (`Session`) and
changes default `solve()`/`ff` behavior for temporal domains — an instance that
previously failed fast can now take substantially longer before returning
`solved: false`, because the escalation ladder tries harder before giving up
(`FF_NO_ESCALATE` restores the single-pass pre-ladder behavior). Two correctness
fixes are included too: a validator/replay bug on `:derived`-axiom domains, and a
domain-authoring bug in the `rpg-world` example (`bread-line` was unsolvable by
construction).

### Added
- **`Session` — ground once, replan many.** The embedding API for callers that
  re-solve the same world every tick (a game's villagers, a simulation loop):
  `Session::new` parses, compiles `:derived` axioms, and grounds ONCE; the session
  then holds the *current world state* — mutate it with `set_fact`/`set_fluent`
  (plus `fact`/`fluent` readbacks) as the world evolves and `replan()` solves from
  wherever it stands, paying only the search. Measured on `villagers`: a
  tick-sized contract (`errand`) drops **223 µs → 22 µs per replan (~10×)**; a
  search-dominated instance (`township`) is break-even, as expected — size
  per-agent contracts small (the decomposer's whole job) and the tax vanishes.
  Static facts are rejected with an explanatory error (grounding bakes them in;
  flipping one could require never-enumerated operators), as are temporal and
  PDDL3-preference inputs (v1 scope). See `examples/replan.rs`.

### Solver
- **Goal-relevance pruning graduated to the default tier.** Previously it rode the
  opt-in `FF_TDEMAND` Full tier only; the default search could exhaust its node
  budget in goal-irrelevant unbounded accumulators (`food=1,2,3,…`) on
  feature-rich domains. Measured trigger: on the rpg-world bread-line hub,
  `flour >= 2` — a 5-step till→plant→irrigate→harvest→mill chain — **failed after
  ~45 s; it now solves in ~30 ms** under defaults. The pass structure gains an
  **unmasked complete backstop** (helpful/sound → full/tight → full/sound →
  full/unmasked), so completeness is now *unconditional* — a hypothetical mask bug
  can cost time, never coverage. `FF_NOREL` disables pruning alone;
  `FF_NO_TDEMAND` still restores the pristine pre-v0.2 path.
- **Static unproducibility check — fail unsolvable goals in microseconds.** If a
  positive goal fact has no adder anywhere in the grounded task, or a `>=`/`>`
  numeric goal's fluent has no effect that could ever raise it, the temporal
  search (and every decomposer contract) now reports unsolvable immediately
  instead of exhausting every pass — bread-line's unproducible goal went from a
  **~45 s** exhaustive failure to **~9 ms**. Sound and conservative: an effect
  counts as a potential raiser unless it provably never raises; the check never
  changes a found plan.
- **Validator/replay fix: `:derived` domains.** Every solve path compiles derived
  axioms into init facts before grounding — but `plan::validate_plan` (the CLI
  `--validate`), `verify::verify`, and `trace::trace` replayed against the **raw**
  problem, so on axiom-using domains (e.g. rpg-world's `(:derived (reachable …))`)
  they wrongly rejected valid plans ("problem grounds to unsolvable" / "unknown
  action") and the GUI animator couldn't trace them. All three now run
  `derived::compile` first (identity when a domain has no axioms).
- **rpg-world domain fix: the bread economy.** `bake-bread` produced `meals`
  directly, leaving the `bread` fluent with **no producer** — so `hard/bread-line`
  was unsolvable-by-construction (violating the hard-set's "solvable in principle"
  contract) and `plate-spread` was dead code. `bake-bread` now yields bread
  (cook bonus included); meals keep their direct path via `cook-meal`, and the
  bread→plate-spread→meals chain is live. `bread-line` now solves and validates
  under default options.
- **On-failure escalation ladder.** When the default-tier monolithic temporal
  search fails, `temporal::solve` now retries at the **Full demand tier**
  (predicate-goal seeding), then hands the goal to the **decomposer** — each rung
  runs only after the previous one failed, so no instance that solves today can
  change its plan; the ladder spends extra time on would-be failures to convert
  them into solves. Ladder gains (all plans independently `--validate`d):
  `crew-solo`/`crew-pair`/`skilled-specialists` at the Full rung (makespans
  109/152/198 — matching their documented flagged solves, now flag-free),
  `order-8`/`order-12` and `found-village` at the decomposer rung. The tier is
  now threaded explicitly through the search (no racy global overrides), the
  decomposer's own monolithic fallbacks are **skipped on the ladder path** (the
  ladder already exhausted that exact search at both tiers — and this is also
  what makes the ladder recursion-free), and TIL-bearing compositions stay safe
  (the decomposer hard-validates before returning). `FF_NO_ESCALATE` — or
  `features::set_escalate_override(false)` in-process (WASM) — disables the
  ladder alone; `FF_NO_TDEMAND` still restores the pristine pre-v0.2 path.
- **Parallel temporal search.** The decision-epoch search now evaluates successor
  heuristics **in parallel** (the `threads` option previously only parallelized
  grounding on the temporal path). Successors are generated serially, batch-
  evaluated across workers (one relaxation `Scratch` per worker; frontiers under
  128 stay on the serial path with zero new allocation — per-round fan-out has to
  amortize against a full unpruned op scan to win), then enqueued serially in
  input order — so the heap and visited-set evolve exactly as before and **plans
  are byte-identical for any thread count**, verified by a corpus-wide
  determinism sweep at `--threads 1/2/4/8` (65 instances, 0 mismatches).
  Measured honestly: the win is modest (~4% on exhaustion-bound searches, ~0 on
  typical solves) — the temporal search is dominated by its serial successor-gen
  / dedup / heap machinery, so this lays the plumbing without changing the
  performance story; the corpus-visible speed lever remains the ladder + pruning.

**Measured** on the full temporal corpus (rpg suite + hard + contracts, cabin,
villagers — 75 instances): **65 → 73 solved, zero losses, zero makespan changes
on previously-solving instances** (pruning graduation +2, escalation ladder +6).
The hard set is now 12/12 — 10 under plain defaults (was 3/12 when authored) and
the two big conjunctive orders via the ladder's decomposer rung. The remaining
corpus misses are `crew-trio` and `skilled-crosstrained`, which resist every
rung — the honest border.

### Benchmarks & docs
- **IPC-5 openstacks: the opt-in `FF_ESPC` gap to SGPlan5 re-measured, ~5× → ~3×.**
  A fresh measurement (`FF_ESPC=1 FF_ESPC_TIME_MS=90000`, 4 cores) narrows the
  scoreboard's headline quality gap: 42/43/55/66/81/90/151/227 vs. the prior
  default row 63/66/62/66/138/129/278/608 across p01–p08, no instance regresses.
  The loop is budget-sensitive — at the *default* 15 s only p01/p02/p06 improve
  on the same box.
- **`docs/espc-preferences-spec.md`: the general-path ESPC blocker has been
  built.** A 2026-07 revisit found that the multi-predicate mutex-group
  synthesis added since the original "deferred" decision (`invariants.rs`) now
  recovers exactly the `(STACKS-AVAIL n)` guidance variable a faithful
  cross-domain ESPC needs — the specific gap the deferred design cited as
  blocking. What remains is "increment 2": coupling the `espc.rs` penalty
  schedule to the partitioned search (subproblems from goal-interaction
  components, global constraints on shared mutex variables). Not yet
  implemented; recorded as the concrete next step.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-06-30 — GUI & tooling

A GUI- and tooling-focused release: the web surfaces and the native Bevy app get a
shared "forge" visual identity, the animator gains a real timeline UI (a scrubbable
transport bar) plus a temporal timescale (Gantt) view, the engine is brought up to
current dependencies, and the publish pre-flight is fast again. No solver/library
API or behavior changes — `ferroplan` / `ferroplan-cli` are functionally identical
to 0.2.1 (dependency refresh only).

### Added
- **Animator transport bar** (native Bevy GUI) — a play/pause button, a scrubbable
  timeline (click or drag to seek, one notch per step), a molten progress fill +
  playhead, and a step/time readout. Mirrors the keyboard controls so the animator is
  usable with the mouse alone.
- **Temporal timescale (Gantt) view** — temporal plans (overlapping durative actions
  the graph can't tween) are now legible: each durative action is a bar on a shared
  plan-time axis, greedily lane-packed so non-overlapping actions share a row, coloured
  by the acting object, with a cyan "now" line swept by the transport playhead. Toggle
  with **T**.
- **Duration-aware playback + active-edge highlight** — classic plans dwell on each
  step in proportion to its `duration`; temporal plans sweep their whole makespan in a
  fixed wall-clock time (relative durations preserved); the edge a mobile is traversing
  at the current timeline position is recoloured molten and thickened.

### Changed
- **"Forge" visual identity** across all three surfaces — the Solver web demo, the
  Bevy visualizer/animator web shell, and the native GUI are restyled to a shared
  dark / molten / cyan palette, and the logo is retinted to match (cyan start, molten
  target).
- **Bevy 0.15 → 0.19** — the GUI is migrated to current Bevy (rendering split into
  `*_render` feature crates, the `Projection` enum, and the `BorderColor` /
  `BorderRadius` / `FontSize` / `ScrollPosition` API changes). Building the GUI now
  needs Rust ≥ 1.95; the published library keeps its 1.74 MSRV (it has no Bevy
  dependency).
- **Dependencies modernized** — `thiserror` 1 → 2, `criterion` 0.5 → 0.8, `pyo3`
  0.24 → 0.29, `wasm-bindgen` pinned to 0.2.126, and the rest brought current.

### Fixed
- **Fast publish pre-flight / `cargo test`** — two IPC-benchmark regression guards
  (`espc` ~346 s, `ipc5_pref_metric` ~175 s) are now `#[ignore]`d, so the default test
  run (and `publish.sh`) finishes in seconds. They remain gated: CI runs them in
  release (`cargo test --release -p ferroplan -- --ignored`), and `RUN_HEAVY=1
  ./publish.sh` (or `cargo test -- --include-ignored`) includes them on demand. No
  assertions changed — only when they run.
- **Bevy GUI black screen on launch** — the 0.19 render features (`bevy_ui_render`,
  `bevy_gizmos_render`, `bevy_sprite_render`) weren't enabled, so the ECS data was
  there but nothing drew.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-26 — "The Bridge"

The engine release (0.1) made ferroplan fast and correct; 0.2 makes the README's
bet real and inspectable: the proven temporal heuristics are on by default, temporal
coverage goes deeper (duration inequalities + timed initial literals), and a goal too
big for the one-shot search is **automatically decomposed** into solvable,
individually-verified contracts.

### Added
- **`parse` API — syntax-check PDDL without solving.** `ferroplan::parse(src)`
  auto-detects domain vs problem, validates syntax, and returns a serde-serializable
  `ParseReport` (ok/error-with-line, name, requirements, and a structure summary:
  types/predicates/functions/actions or objects/init/goal/metric/TIL counts) — fast
  feedback for an authoring loop or editor tooling, no grounding or solving. Exposed
  as a **`parse` MCP tool** too.
- **MCP server (`ferroplan-mcp`)** — a Model Context Protocol server exposing
  `solve`, `validate`, and `decompose` to an LLM agent over stdio, so the agent can
  *author and supervise* PDDL and let the planner run deterministically (the README's
  bet, made operational). A self-contained newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 loop — no
  async runtime, deps limited to `serde`/`serde_json` — that returns the structured
  `Solution` / `Decomposition` as tool results, reports tool failures as `isError`
  results (so the agent can correct its PDDL), and never panics on input. Integration
  tests drive the built binary end to end. (`publish = false` for now; not in the
  crates.io release set yet.)
- **Goal decomposer — `decompose` API + `ff --decompose`** (the README's bet, made
  inspectable). A temporal goal too big for the one-shot search is split into ordered
  sub-contracts — each small enough to solve whole and individually verified — then
  stitched into one validated plan. This surfaces the partition-and-resolve engine
  (previously only the `FF_TDECOMP` flag, which returned just the flat plan) as a
  first-class, typed, serde-serializable `Decomposition { contracts, plan, monolithic }`
  where each `Contract` names its sub-goal (`(order o1), (order o2)`, `coin >= 15`),
  its sub-plan, and its offset in the stitched timeline. A goal that can't be split —
  or whose split doesn't validate — falls back to a single monolithic contract,
  reported honestly. `ff --decompose` prints the breakdown (text or `--json`).
  Demonstrated on `examples/rpg-world/hard/order-8` & `order-12` (8 / 12 contracts),
  which the one-shot temporal search fails on. `ferroplan::decompose(domain, problem,
  &Options)`; `tresolve::solve` now delegates to the recording `decompose` (the
  `FF_TDECOMP` plan path is unchanged).
- **Timed initial literals (PDDL2.2)** — `(at <time> <literal>)` in `:init` (including
  `(at <time> (not <literal>))`) now schedules an exogenous fact change at a fixed
  absolute time, disambiguated from the ordinary `(at ?x ?y)` predicate by a numeric
  first argument. Each TIL compiles to a synthetic 0-arg applier action (so its fact
  is grounded and a goal reachable only via a TIL isn't pruned as a relaxed dead end);
  the decision-epoch search fires it from a pre-seeded agenda at its time, the STN
  re-timing floors TIL-gated actions at their scheduled instant so they can't slide
  before their gate, and the in-crate validator replays TILs up to the plan horizon.
  Off the temporal path, TILs are inert (heap key byte-identical).
- **Temporal duration inequalities** — `:duration` now accepts `(>= ?duration L)`,
  `(<= ?duration U)`, and `(and ...)` ranges in addition to the fixed
  `(= ?duration e)`. The decision-epoch search commits to the **shortest feasible**
  duration (the lower bound), and the in-crate temporal validator accepts any
  duration within `[min, max]` (a fixed `=` collapses the range to a point,
  recovering exact-equality). Durations remain constant or parameter-dependent.
  (IPC temporal domains aren't vendored — licences — so this is exercised by
  crafted inequality domains + `temporal::validate`; the fixed-duration RPG corpus
  is unchanged, 26/27 suite.)

### Changed
- **Temporal demand guidance is now on by default** (graduated from the opt-in
  `FF_TDEMAND`). The default is a new **`Numeric`** tier: demand is seeded from
  *numeric goals only* — the measured multi-round win (`steel ≥ 2`, `grain ≥ 10`,
  `coin ≥ 15`). Validated on the RPG `suite/` + `hard/` corpus: **26 → 34/39
  solved, no regression** vs. the old default, and crucially *without* the makespan
  regression a blind graduation would cause — the previously-coupled
  predicate-goal-threshold seeding reads a renewable-pool guard (`(>= (avail) 1)`,
  net-zero) as accumulation demand and serializes concurrency domains (a unit
  `crew` pool of 2 went concurrent-~5 → serialized-~10). That structural/predicate
  half — plus goal-relevance pruning — now rides an explicit **`Full`** tier
  (`FF_TDEMAND`), which additionally solves the one structural build
  (`gather-build`) the numeric default gives up (decomposer territory per
  `examples/BORDERS.md`).
  - Opt out entirely with **`FF_NO_TDEMAND`** (heap key bit-identical to 0.1.0).
  - Library / WASM callers: `features::set_overrides` is now tri-state-backed
    (`true` / `false` are definitive; new `features::clear_overrides` returns to
    default + env), and the active tier is queryable via `features::demand_mode()`
    (`Off` / `Numeric` / `Full`).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-24

Initial public release.

### Added
- Data-parallel FF planner core (bitset / CSR, parallel grounding + heuristic).
- **Enforced hill-climbing (EHC)** with helpful actions and a weighted-best-first
  fallback — the default, ~3× faster than best-first and metric-ff-class on
  classical/ADL (geomean 0.21× → 0.66× Metric-FF).
- **Configurable `Options`** (library-first; CLI flags + JSON map to the same
  fields): `mode`, `search`, `helpful_actions`, `weight_g/weight_h`, `threads`,
  `max_evaluated`, `optimize`.
- ADL: conditional effects, `forall`/`exists`, object equality.
- Numeric fluents (Metric-FF style).
- **Derived predicates / axioms** (`:derived`, static / stratified) — closed into
  the initial state via a datalog fixpoint.
- PDDL3 soft-goal preferences (incl. `forall`-quantified and precondition
  preferences) with anytime branch-and-bound metric optimization. IPC-5 coverage
  on par with SGPlan6 (39/48).
- **PDDL2.1 temporal**: durative actions with `at start`/`over all`/`at end`
  conditions & effects, constant or parameter-dependent durations, required
  concurrency, and ε-separation; decision-epoch search; IPC temporal plan output
  with makespan. Plans validated against VAL on real IPC domains (44/45 valid);
  an independent in-crate validator (`temporal::validate`).
- SGPlan-style partition-and-resolve mode.
- **ESPC penalty-resolution loop** (`FF_ESPC`, opt-in) — SGPlan's Extended
  Saddle-Point Condition adaptive penalty coordination, applied to the PDDL3
  preference metric path. It penalizes, on the *concrete* state, once-only
  conditional achievements that fire without delivering (openstacks: a product
  made while its orders still wait — a permanently lost preference the
  delete-relaxed heuristic is blind to), and adapts a **per-trigger** penalty
  across an outer loop, keeping the best plan as an anytime incumbent. Iteration 0
  runs the penalty-free B&B as a floor, so the loop can only improve, never
  regress. Narrows the metric-quality gap on openstacks at the default budget
  (p01 63→42, p02 66→43, p05 138→81, p06 129→90, p08 608→227); a larger
  `FF_ESPC_TIME_MS` / more threads improves the hardest instances further
  (e.g. p07 278→142). The loop is wall-clock-bounded (default 15 s, tunable) and
  always returns its incumbent inside that budget, so it never loses coverage
  under a harness timeout. Inert on every domain without the make-deadline
  structure — including the whole numeric/temporal RPG corpus — and bit-identical
  to the prior default when off. Auto-tunes per instance (no manual weight); never
  claims optimality. See `docs/espc-preferences-spec.md`.
- **Temporal converging-resource demand guidance** (`FF_TDEMAND`, opt-in) — the
  ESPC concrete-state idea ported to the durative/numeric (RPG) search. It regresses
  the numeric goal down the recipe DAG to a TOTAL per-resource demand (`steel ≥ 2` ⇒
  ingots/coal/ore ≥ 2, logs ≥ 4 — bridging snap-compiled start/end the way the
  landmark extractor does) and guides on cumulative availability (init + produced,
  clamped), which survives consumption across rounds. This is the gradient the
  delete-relaxed heuristic lacks once ≥2 contributions converge on a goal quantity
  (see `examples/BORDERS.md`). Phase-1 key only — phase 2 stays byte-identical, so
  completeness holds. Measured on the RPG corpus: **+8 instances solved (26→34/39),
  all plans validated, no regressions**, cracking three shapes the relaxation went
  flat on — multi-round converging DAGs (tech-steel/bronze), cyclic resource regen
  (farmstead `grain≥10`), and multi-path numeric goals (mint-fortune/trade `coin≥N`).
  Off by default (heap key bit-identical when unset).
- **Temporal partition-and-resolve decomposer** (`FF_TDECOMP`, opt-in) — the SGPlan
  partition loop (`resolve.rs`) brought to the durative/numeric path for the
  conjunctive/structural goals the demand term can't crack. A reusable
  `temporal::solve_from(start, goal, forbidden)` subplanner (the temporal analog of
  `solve_subgoal_avoiding`) lets the decomposer partition the world goal into
  contracts, solve each from the running composed state, splice the timed subplans
  strictly sequentially (each offset past the prior makespan + an ε seam), and MERGE
  groups on conflict down to a monolithic `temporal::solve` — so it is solvable
  EXACTLY when the monolithic search is (completeness preserved). Same-epoch
  happenings order on an ε-grid-rounded key (ends before starts) so the offset
  concatenation validates without re-separation. Measured: solves the large mixed
  conjunctive goals `order-8`/`order-12` (RPG temporal 34→36/39), every composed
  plan validated, zero regressions, default path byte-identical. Remaining fails
  (`found-village`, `gather-build`) reduce correctly to a *pre-existing* predicate-
  build (`build-house`/village-shape) search blowup — the next target, separate from
  the decomposer. Groundwork for it (predicate-goal demand seeding; predicate-
  precondition contract regression) is in place behind the same flag.
- **Temporal goal-relevance pruning** (rides `FF_TDEMAND`; `FF_NOREL` disables) — a
  backward closure from the goal marks every op that can contribute (adds/deletes a
  relevant fact or increases a relevant resource, transitively pulling in its
  preconditions and consumed resources); non-contributing ops are pruned from BOTH
  search phases. Fixes the predicate-build blowup: the diagnosis showed phase 1
  (helpful actions) gets stuck under delete-relaxation (the agent is relaxed-
  omnipresent, so travel is never "helpful"), and the COMPLETE phase 2 then drowns in
  goal-irrelevant unbounded accumulators (`forage-food`/`gather-herbs` → food=1,2,3,…).
  Pruning to the relevant subspace lets the search solve instead of exploding. Two
  masks drive three passes — helpful(sound) → full(TIGHT) → full(sound): the SOUND
  mask keeps every producer of a relevant resource (completeness-preserving, the final
  backstop); the TIGHT mask keeps only each resource's single best-yield producer, so
  marking `planks` relevant pulls in `saw-planks` but NOT the alternative producer
  `haul-cargo` (which would otherwise drag the whole logistics subsystem in and
  re-explode). Off by default (empty masks ⇒ op set bit-identical, original two-pass
  behavior). Solves `gather-build` AND `found-village` (RPG temporal 36→38/39); every
  plan validated, no regressions, full suite green. The lone remaining miss,
  `bread-line`, is a pre-existing relaxed dead-end unrelated to relevance.
- **Concurrent temporal scheduling** (`FF_TCONC`, opt-in) — a scheduling phase
  (`tsched`) for durative plans. The decision-epoch search is action-count-guided, so
  it lays actions out sequentially and more workers never shortened the makespan; this
  repacks the found plan onto the domain's actor-objects — one job per worker at a
  time, each action starting as early as its consumed resources and prerequisite
  predicates allow — to minimize makespan. The multi-actor search is flaky, so it
  searches a single-actor reduction and reassigns the plan across the real crew. Every
  rescheduled plan is run through `temporal::validate` and kept only if shorter, so it
  can only improve a plan, never produce a wrong one; default path byte-identical.
  Showcase (`examples/cabin`): a durative crew build where 1→2→3 workers cut makespan
  109→63→47 on the same job.
- **Worker skills** — a task's actor-referencing precondition (e.g. `(smith ?w)`) is
  read by the scheduler as a required capability, so skill-gated tasks are assigned
  only to workers who have them (location is handled the same way); the single-actor
  reduction becomes a super-worker (union of all skills) so the search still finds the
  plan, and a task needing a skill no worker has is correctly unsolvable. Shown in
  `examples/cabin/crew-skilled` (sawyer/smith routing) and a "forge order" where the
  smith is the bottleneck — two extra labourers barely move it (65→62) but a second
  smith at the same crew size cuts ~a third (65→44).
- **WASM feature overrides** (`crate::features`) — the env-gated temporal switches
  (`FF_TDEMAND`/`FF_TDECOMP`/`FF_TCONC`) reachable from non-CLI callers via a process
  override OR'd with the env read (env *writes* panic on `wasm32`), surfaced through
  the WASM `plan(domain, problem, mode, flags)` `flags` arg — so the browser demo runs
  the demand guidance, decomposer, and concurrent scheduler too.
- Library API returning structured, `serde`-serializable results.
- `ff` CLI: drop-in `-o/-f` text, `--json`, `--json-request` job I/O, full
  strategy flags.
- **Robust** against malformed input — pathological/deeply-nested PDDL returns a
  typed error, never a panic.
- **SAS+ / mutex groups** — Helmert-style multi-predicate invariant synthesis,
  feeding SGPlan-style subgoal partitioning + resolution.
- **General metric terms** — the metric optimizer folds monotone numeric fluent
  terms (e.g. rovers' `(sum-traverse-cost)`) into total-cost, so all six IPC-5
  simple-preferences domains are scored, rovers included.
- **Bindings (reach)** — `ferroplan-wasm`: run the planner in the browser via
  WebAssembly with a self-contained "try it" demo (no server/install);
  `ferroplan-py`: a pyo3 **abi3** wheel (`import ferroplan; ferroplan.plan(domain,
  problem)`), one wheel for CPython 3.8+. The core stays pure Rust.
- mdBook documentation site; cross-planner comparison harness (`compare.py`),
  temporal+VAL harness (`bench_temporal.py`), and benchmark results vs
  Metric-FF / SGPlan6 / VAL.
- **Worked-domain corpus + coverage borders** (`examples/`) — a ~120-action
  crafting/economy domain (`rpg-world`) with validated contracts, a flavor-×-scale
  `suite/`, an adversarial `hard/` batch, and an `industrial-city` decomposition
  showcase; plus `logistics` (transshipment) and `jobshop` (machine-scheduling,
  scales to 100 jobs) domains. `examples/BORDERS.md` is a measured map of where
  one-shot planning solves vs. where a goal must be decomposed into contracts. Also
  `villagers` — the generic, data-driven recipe model a live game embeds (3 actions:
  walk/gather/craft, recipes as `:init` data; the abstract counterpart to rpg-world) —
  and `cabin`, a deep linear build (fell→mill→smith→glaze→raise, ~52 steps) with a
  durative "parallel crew" twin showing makespan vs. crew size and worker skills.
- **Claude Code skill** (`.claude/skills/ferroplan`) — PDDL-authoring guidance, a
  CLI/feature reference, and six per-feature examples each re-verified to solve,
  enforcing an author → run → read-the-plan loop.
- **GUI / web** — per-type procedural icons (incl. a machine icon for scheduling
  domains) and relation-colored edges (rail vs road vs stage routing). The in-browser
  WASM demo is a **two-level picker** (choose a domain, then a problem graded
  simplest→most-complex), with an execution toggle (**Web Worker** — responsive +
  cancelable — or main thread, for environments that block workers), solve-on-button
  so a heavy problem never auto-freezes the tab, and per-example **feature flags** that
  enable the demand guidance / decomposer / concurrent scheduler in-browser. Includes a
  `border` example that shows where one-shot planning gives out.

### Performance
- **Grounding** — restrict each parameter's domain by its static unary
  preconditions before enumerating; fixes untyped cartesian-product blowup
  (gripper p02 658µs→247µs, 2.65×; large untyped grounding 1.56s→~0). See
  `docs/perf-notes.md`.
- **EHC** — work cap scaled by op count so large-but-easy instances finish in
  EHC's near-greedy arm instead of unpruned best-first (gripper-250 `--mode ff`
  2.16M evals/33s → 32k/0.86s, 38×).
- **Temporal search** — a weighted-`g` heap key plus two-phase helpful-action
  pruning (a pruned `g+h` phase, then the original complete pure-`h` phase) takes
  multi-step long-chain contracts from timeout to instant. A numeric-threshold
  landmark term (phase-1 key only, so the complete pass is byte-identical) then
  restores the heuristic gradient on converging recipe DAGs — a from-scratch ingot
  and the metallurgy benchmark go from no-plan to instant, and deep accumulations
  get 10–60× faster. No regression on the existing temporal suite.

### Known limitations
- Numeric domains trail Metric-FF (EHC falls back to best-first on some).
- IPC-5 preference metric *quality* on the hardest instances still trails SGPlan6;
  retroactively, ferroplan places ~2nd in the field (SGPlan5 swept). The opt-in
  ESPC penalty-resolution loop (`FF_ESPC`, see above and
  `docs/espc-preferences-spec.md`) narrows the openstacks gap substantially
  (~11–63% per instance) but does not close it — reaching SGPlan's level needs a
  dedicated minimum-open-stacks scheduler, not a relaxation-guided search. ESPC is
  off by default while the cross-domain sweep matures.
- The metric branch-and-bound does not scale to instances with hundreds of
  preferences (e.g. storage p05+) — the Keyder–Geffner compilation grows large.
- Temporal coverage is search-limited on the largest *monolithic* instances; the
  intended path past the border is decomposition into contracts (see
  `examples/BORDERS.md`).
- Not supported: duration inequalities, timed initial literals, continuous (`#t`)
  effects, and *dynamic* derived predicates (static / stratified axioms are
  supported).
